  Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating
  work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development.
  It was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers
  contributing to its initial development. Git is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
  speed and efficiency. It is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning-fast performance. Git is widely used by
  developers worldwide for a range of applications, including deep learning and machine learning, signal processing and communications,
  image and video processing, control systems, test and measurement, computational finance, and computational biology.
