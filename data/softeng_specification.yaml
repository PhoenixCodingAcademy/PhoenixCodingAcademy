  # Overview

  A software product specification (SPS) is a written document that explains what you want and how you will know if you get it.
  It is often called then "specs" or "requirements".

  There are million ways to write an SPS. Only a few are good ways. Many specs are formal patterns, and many are just ad hoc.
  Less important is how to write them. More important is what principles to follow when writing them. Here, we talk about those principles:

  # Principles

  ## Write for your understanding
  > Writing shows us how sloppy our thinking is.

  ## Write with the reader in mind.

  Bad writers write for themselves to read; to check some documentation box. Good writers write for and have empathy for the reader.
  You understand the topic. That's why you are writing it. Taking your knowledge for granted is one big mistake in writing for others.
  Assume the reader doesn't know something and at minimal, provide a link to ramp up quickly.

  ## Think like a lawyer

  If there are multiple ways to interpret something written, then assume the reader will accidentally (or worse deliberately) interpret it the wrong way.
