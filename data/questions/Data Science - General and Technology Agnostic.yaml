    explanation: This describes unsupervised learning, not zero-shot learning.

- question: What is continual learning (also called lifelong learning)?
  points: 7
  right:
  - answer: A learning paradigm where models continuously learn from a stream of data over time while retaining previously learned knowledge without catastrophic forgetting
    explanation: Continual learning addresses the challenge of learning new tasks without forgetting old ones, important for adaptive systems.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_learning
  wrong:
  - answer: Learning that never stops and runs indefinitely
    explanation: While continual learning is ongoing, this oversimplifies the concept.
  - answer: A philosophy of continuous improvement in data science practice
    explanation: This describes professional development, not the machine learning paradigm.
  - answer: Models that are continuously monitored in production
    explanation: This describes monitoring, not continual learning.
  - answer: The practice of retraining models regularly on schedule
    explanation: This describes periodic retraining, not the continual learning paradigm.
  - answer: Learning that continues until perfect accuracy is achieved
    explanation: This misunderstands continual learning's focus on sequential task learning.

- question: What is the exploration-exploitation tradeoff?
  points: 7
  right:
  - answer: The dilemma in reinforcement learning between trying new actions to discover their rewards (exploration) versus choosing known good actions (exploitation)
    explanation: Balancing exploration and exploitation is fundamental to reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandit problems.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit
  wrong:
  - answer: The choice between exploring data thoroughly versus exploiting it for insights
    explanation: While thematically related, this doesn't define the RL concept.
  - answer: The balance between exploratory data analysis and model exploitation
    explanation: This describes data science workflow, not the RL tradeoff.
  - answer: The tension between discovering new features versus exploiting known ones
    explanation: This is about feature engineering, not the RL exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
  - answer: The decision between exploring multiple models versus exploiting the best one
    explanation: This is about model selection, not the RL concept.
  - answer: The tradeoff between computational exploration time and result exploitation
    explanation: This describes computational efficiency, not the RL dilemma.

- question: What is a policy in reinforcement learning?
  points: 4
  right:
  - answer: A strategy or mapping from states to actions that determines what action an agent should take in each state
    explanation: Policies can be deterministic (one action per state) or stochastic (probability distribution over actions), and learning optimal policies is the goal of many RL algorithms.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#Policy
  wrong:
  - answer: The set of rules governing data privacy in machine learning
    explanation: This describes data governance policies, not RL policies.
  - answer: A documented guideline for model development and deployment
    explanation: This describes organizational policies, not RL policies.
  - answer: The loss function used to train reinforcement learning models
    explanation: This describes the objective function, not the policy.
  - answer: A quality control policy for ensuring data integrity
    explanation: This describes data policies, not RL policies.
  - answer: The algorithm used to update model parameters
    explanation: This describes the learning algorithm, not the policy being learned.

- question: What is the reward function in reinforcement learning?
  points: 4
  right:
  - answer: A function that provides feedback to the agent by assigning numerical rewards or penalties for taking actions in specific states
    explanation: The reward function defines the task objective and guides the agent toward desired behaviors.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#Reward_function
  wrong:
  - answer: A bonus paid to data scientists for achieving good model performance
    explanation: This describes employee compensation, not RL reward functions.
  - answer: The evaluation metric used to assess model quality
    explanation: While related, evaluation metrics are different from RL reward functions that guide learning.
  - answer: A function that rewards the model with more training data
    explanation: This misunderstands what rewards are in RL.
  - answer: The mathematical function that calculates model predictions
    explanation: This describes the prediction function, not the reward function.
  - answer: A feature that indicates how rewarding each data point is
    explanation: Rewards are feedback for actions, not properties of data points.

- question: What is the difference between model accuracy and model precision?
  points: 2
  right:
  - answer: Accuracy measures overall correctness (all correct predictions divided by total predictions), while precision measures correctness of positive predictions only (true positives divided by all positive predictions)
    explanation: Both are useful but precision is specifically important when false positives are costly.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall
  wrong:
  - answer: Accuracy is for classification, precision is for regression
    explanation: Both terms apply to classification; regression uses different metrics.
  - answer: Accuracy is approximate, precision is exact
    explanation: Both are specific mathematical measures, not degrees of exactness.
  - answer: There is no difference; they are synonyms
    explanation: These are distinct evaluation metrics with different meanings.
  - answer: Accuracy uses integers, precision uses decimals
    explanation: Both can be expressed as decimals or percentages.
  - answer: Precision is accuracy rounded to a specific number of decimal places
    explanation: This confuses numerical precision with the classification metric.
