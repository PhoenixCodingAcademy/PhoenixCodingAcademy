? Which are homoiconic languages?
+ LISP
  LISP is the most popular example of a language whose data and code are interchangeable.
  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity#In_Lisp
+ Clojure
  Because it is a derivative of LISP
+ Racket
  Because it is a derivative of LISP
+ Scheme
  Because it is a derivative of LISP
+ Prolog
  The modeling language of Horn Clauses in Prolog make its code and data the same.
  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity#In_Prolog
+ Rebol
  Where LISP uses parenthesis, Rebol uses bracket. But its a similar concept.
  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity#In_Rebol
+ Red
  Red was designed to overcome some difficulties in Rebol.
