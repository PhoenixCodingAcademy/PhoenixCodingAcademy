    explanation: Observational studies can identify associations but generally cannot establish causation due to potential confounding.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study
  wrong:
  - answer: A study where researchers control all variables
    explanation: This describes an experiment, not an observational study.
  - answer: A study that proves causation
    explanation: Observational studies typically cannot establish causation as definitively as experiments.
  - answer: Only useful for categorical data
    explanation: Observational studies can involve any type of data.
  - answer: A study conducted by watching people without their knowledge
    explanation: While observation may be involved, the key is lack of manipulation, and ethics require informed consent.
  - answer: Less valid than experimental studies in all cases
    explanation: Observational studies have different strengths and are sometimes the only ethical or practical option.

- question: What does "controlling for a variable" mean?
  reason: Statistical control is essential for analyzing complex data and isolating effects in multiple regression and ANCOVA.
  points: 7
  right:
  - answer: Accounting for the effects of a variable to isolate the relationship between other variables
    explanation: Statistical techniques like multiple regression can control for confounders by including them in the model.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlling_for_a_variable
  wrong:
  - answer: Removing all observations with extreme values
    explanation: This describes outlier removal, not controlling for a variable.
  - answer: Keeping a variable constant in an experiment
    explanation: This is experimental control, which is related but different from statistical control.
  - answer: Calculating the mean of a variable
    explanation: Calculating summaries is not controlling for a variable.
  - answer: Ensuring the variable is normally distributed
    explanation: Distribution checks are separate from controlling for variables.
  - answer: Collecting more data on a variable
    explanation: Data collection doesn't constitute controlling for a variable.

- question: What is a paired t-test used for?
  reason: Paired tests are common in before-after studies and matched designs in business and research settings.
  points: 7
  right:
  - answer: Comparing means when the two samples are matched or dependent, such as before-and-after measurements on the same subjects
    explanation: Paired t-tests account for correlation between measurements, increasing statistical power.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Dependent_t-test_for_paired_samples
  wrong:
  - answer: Comparing means of two independent groups
    explanation: This requires an independent samples t-test, not a paired t-test.
  - answer: Comparing more than two groups
    explanation: This requires ANOVA, not a t-test.
  - answer: Testing correlation between two variables
    explanation: Correlation tests differ from paired t-tests.
  - answer: Comparing proportions
    explanation: Proportions typically use z-tests or chi-square tests.
  - answer: Testing if the variance of two groups differs
    explanation: This requires an F-test for equality of variances.

- question: What is the difference between precision and accuracy?
  reason: These concepts are fundamental for understanding measurement quality and interpreting results correctly.
  points: 4
  right:
  - answer: Accuracy is closeness to the true value; precision is consistency of repeated measurements
    explanation: You can be precise (consistent) but inaccurate (consistently wrong), or accurate on average but imprecise (variable).
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision
  wrong:
  - answer: Precision and accuracy mean the same thing
    explanation: These are distinct concepts in measurement theory.
  - answer: Accuracy applies to large samples; precision applies to small samples
    explanation: Both concepts apply regardless of sample size.
  - answer: Precision is more important than accuracy
    explanation: Both are important; their relative importance depends on the context.
  - answer: Accuracy is about random error; precision is about systematic error
    explanation: This is backwards; accuracy relates to systematic error (bias), precision relates to random error.
  - answer: Precision measures mean; accuracy measures standard deviation
    explanation: These statistical measures relate to but don't define precision and accuracy.

- question: What does it mean to say a test is "robust"?
  reason: Robustness affects which statistical methods can be safely used when assumptions are not perfectly met.
  points: 7
  right:
  - answer: The test performs well even when some of its assumptions are violated
    explanation: Robust tests, like t-tests for reasonably large samples, give valid results despite moderate departures from assumptions.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics
  wrong:
  - answer: The test requires strict assumptions to be met
    explanation: This is the opposite of robustness.
  - answer: The test is always correct
    explanation: No test is always correct; robustness means performance holds up under assumption violations.
  - answer: The test has high power
    explanation: Power and robustness are related but different properties.
  - answer: The test works only with large samples
    explanation: Robustness refers to assumption violations, not sample size requirements.
  - answer: The test never makes Type I errors
    explanation: No test completely eliminates errors; robustness is about maintaining valid error rates.

- question: What is a non-parametric test?
  reason: Non-parametric tests are important alternatives when data don't meet parametric test assumptions.
  points: 7
  right:
  - answer: A statistical test that does not assume a specific distribution for the population
    explanation: Non-parametric tests often use ranks rather than raw values and are useful when normality assumptions are violated.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics
  wrong:
  - answer: A test that has no parameters
    explanation: Non-parametric tests still have parameters; they don't assume a specific distributional form.
  - answer: A test only for categorical data
    explanation: Non-parametric tests can be used with various data types, including continuous data.
  - answer: A less powerful test in all situations
    explanation: Non-parametric tests may have less power when parametric assumptions are met but more power when they're violated.
  - answer: A test that requires the population standard deviation
    explanation: Non-parametric tests typically don't require population parameters.
  - answer: The same as a parametric test
    explanation: These are distinct classes of tests with different assumptions.

- question: What is the Mann-Whitney U test?
  reason: This non-parametric test is a practical alternative to t-tests when data are skewed or ordinal.
  points: 7
  right:
  - answer: A non-parametric test for comparing two independent groups, used as an alternative to the independent t-test
    explanation: The Mann-Whitney test compares distributions using ranks rather than assuming normality.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test
  wrong:
  - answer: A parametric test assuming normality
    explanation: Mann-Whitney is non-parametric and doesn't assume normality.
  - answer: A test for paired samples
    explanation: For paired samples, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used instead.
  - answer: A test for comparing more than two groups
    explanation: For more than two groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test is used.
  - answer: Another name for the t-test
    explanation: Mann-Whitney is a different test, though it addresses similar questions.
  - answer: A test only for categorical data
    explanation: Mann-Whitney is for ordinal or continuous data, not categorical data.

- question: What is statistical inference?
  reason: Understanding inference is the foundation of using sample data to draw broader conclusions.
  points: 2
  right:
  - answer: The process of drawing conclusions about populations based on sample data
    explanation: Inference includes estimation (confidence intervals) and hypothesis testing.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference
  wrong:
  - answer: Calculating descriptive statistics only
    explanation: Descriptive statistics summarize data; inference goes beyond the sample to the population.
  - answer: Proving hypotheses are true
    explanation: Inference provides evidence and estimates with uncertainty, not proof.
  - answer: Collecting data from a population
    explanation: This is data collection; inference is drawing conclusions from the data.
  - answer: Creating graphs and charts
    explanation: Visualization is part of data analysis but not statistical inference per se.
  - answer: Calculating the exact population parameter
    explanation: Inference provides estimates with uncertainty, not exact values.

- question: What is a point estimate?
  reason: Point estimates are the foundation of statistical reporting and must be understood before learning about intervals.
  points: 2
  right:
  - answer: A single value that serves as an estimate of a population parameter
    explanation: Examples include using the sample mean x̄ to estimate μ, or sample proportion to estimate population proportion.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimation
  wrong:
  - answer: A range of plausible values for a parameter
    explanation: This describes an interval estimate, not a point estimate.
  - answer: The exact value of the population parameter
    explanation: Point estimates are estimates that approximate but don't equal the true parameter.
  - answer: The margin of error
    explanation: Margin of error is used with point estimates to create intervals.
  - answer: A dot on a scatter plot
    explanation: This is a literal point on a graph, not a point estimate.
  - answer: The standard error
    explanation: Standard error measures uncertainty of an estimate; the point estimate is the value itself.

- question: What is an interval estimate?
  reason: Interval estimates communicate uncertainty and are more informative than point estimates alone.
  points: 2
  right:
  - answer: A range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter
    explanation: Confidence intervals are the most common type of interval estimate.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_estimation
  wrong:
  - answer: A single best guess for a parameter
    explanation: This describes a point estimate, not an interval estimate.
  - answer: The range of the sample data
    explanation: This is the data range, not an interval estimate for a parameter.
  - answer: The interquartile range
    explanation: IQR describes data spread, not uncertainty about a parameter.
  - answer: The time period over which data was collected
    explanation: This is a temporal interval, not a statistical interval estimate.
  - answer: Always 95% of the data
    explanation: Confidence intervals are about parameters, not percentages of data.

- question: When would you use the median instead of the mean?
  reason: Choosing appropriate measures of central tendency is crucial for accurate data summarization and reporting.
  points: 4
  right:
  - answer: When the data is skewed or contains outliers
    explanation: The median is resistant to extreme values, making it more representative of typical values in skewed distributions.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median
  - answer: When the data is ordinal
    explanation: For ordinal data, the median is appropriate while the mean may not be meaningful.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement
  wrong:
  - answer: Never; the mean is always better
    explanation: The median is preferable in several situations, particularly with skewed data.
  - answer: Only when the sample size is small
    explanation: Sample size alone doesn't determine whether to use median or mean.
  - answer: When you want to emphasize extreme values
    explanation: The mean, not the median, is influenced by extreme values.
  - answer: Only for categorical data
    explanation: The median requires ordinal or higher measurement level, not categorical.
  - answer: When calculating confidence intervals
    explanation: Confidence intervals can be constructed for either mean or median, depending on the situation.

- question: What information does a box plot provide?
  reason: Box plots efficiently summarize multiple aspects of distributions and are widely used in comparative analysis.
  points: 2
  right:
  - answer: Minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, and outliers
    explanation: Box plots display the five-number summary and identify potential outliers.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot
  - answer: The shape of the distribution (symmetry or skewness)
    explanation: Box plots reveal whether data is symmetric or skewed based on the position of the median within the box.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot
  - answer: The spread of the middle 50% of the data (IQR)
    explanation: The box itself represents the interquartile range.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot
  wrong:
  - answer: The mean and standard deviation
    explanation: Traditional box plots show quartiles and median, not mean and standard deviation.
  - answer: The frequency of each value
    explanation: Histograms show frequencies; box plots show distributional summary.
  - answer: The correlation between two variables
    explanation: Scatter plots show correlations; box plots show distribution of one variable.

- question: What is the purpose of a control group in an experiment?
  reason: Control groups are fundamental to causal inference in experimental designs including A/B testing.
  points: 4
  right:
  - answer: To provide a baseline for comparison to isolate the effect of the treatment
    explanation: The control group doesn't receive the treatment, allowing researchers to see what happens without intervention.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups
  wrong:
  - answer: To control all variables in the experiment
    explanation: The control group is a comparison group, not a method for controlling variables.
  - answer: To increase the sample size
    explanation: While control groups add participants, their purpose is comparison, not just increasing size.
  - answer: To ensure the experiment is ethical
    explanation: Ethics are important but aren't the primary purpose of control groups.
  - answer: To eliminate random error
    explanation: Control groups help isolate treatment effects but don't eliminate random error.
  - answer: To replace randomization
    explanation: Control groups and randomization serve different but complementary purposes.

- question: What is a treatment group in an experiment?
  reason: Understanding experimental structure is essential for designing and interpreting controlled studies.
  points: 2
  right:
  - answer: The group that receives the intervention or condition being tested
    explanation: The treatment group is exposed to the independent variable to observe its effect.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups
  wrong:
  - answer: The group that receives no intervention
    explanation: This describes the control group, not the treatment group.
  - answer: The group with medical conditions
    explanation: '"Treatment" in experiments refers to any intervention, not just medical treatments.'
  - answer: The group analyzed first
    explanation: Order of analysis doesn't define treatment vs. control groups.
  - answer: The smaller of the two groups
    explanation: Group size doesn't determine which is treatment or control.
  - answer: The group selected first
    explanation: Selection order doesn't determine group designation.

- question: What is replication in statistics?
  reason: Replication strengthens evidence and is crucial for scientific validity and business decision-making.
  points: 4
  right:
  - answer: Repeating a study or experiment to verify results
    explanation: Replication helps confirm findings aren't due to chance or specific to one sample.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(statistics)
  - answer: Having multiple measurements or observations within a study
    explanation: Within-study replication (repeated measures) provides more precise estimates.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(statistics)
  wrong:
  - answer: Copying data from one spreadsheet to another
    explanation: This is data duplication, not statistical replication.
  - answer: Using the same statistical test multiple times
    explanation: Multiple testing is different from replication of studies.
  - answer: Plagiarizing research
    explanation: Replication means repeating methods with new data, not plagiarism.
  - answer: Always getting the same results
    explanation: Replications won't give identical results due to sampling variability, but should show consistent patterns.
