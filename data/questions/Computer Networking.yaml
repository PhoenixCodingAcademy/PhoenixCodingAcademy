- question: Which of the following are false statements about subnetting?
  points: 7
  right:
  - answer: Subnetting reduces the total number of available host addresses
    explanation: This is true, not false; subnet and broadcast addresses reduce usable hosts, making this a wrong answer for false statements.

- question: Which of the following are true statements about NAT (Network Address Translation)?
  points: 4
  right:
  - answer: NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address
    explanation: NAT translates multiple private IP addresses to a single or pool of public IP addresses.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation
  - answer: NAT operates at Layer 3 and sometimes Layer 4 of the OSI model
    explanation: NAT works with IP addresses (Layer 3) and often port numbers (Layer 4) for PAT/NAPT.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation
  - answer: PAT (Port Address Translation) is a type of NAT
    explanation: PAT, also called NAT overload, uses port numbers to multiplex multiple private addresses to one public address.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation
  - answer: NAT can complicate some applications that embed IP addresses in their payload
    explanation: Applications like FTP and SIP can have issues with NAT because they include IP addresses in application data.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation
  wrong:
  - answer: NAT is required for all internet connections
    explanation: NAT is commonly used but not required; with sufficient public IPs, devices can connect directly.
  - answer: NAT provides strong security equivalent to a firewall
    explanation: While NAT provides some obscurity, it's not a security solution; dedicated firewalls are needed.
  - answer: NAT works by encrypting IP addresses
    explanation: NAT translates addresses but doesn't encrypt them.
  - answer: NAT is unnecessary with IPv6
    explanation: While IPv6 reduces the need for NAT due to abundant addresses, this statement is too absolute; NAT can still be used.
  - answer: Static NAT always uses port translation
    explanation: Static NAT creates one-to-one mappings between private and public IPs without necessarily using port translation.

- question: Which of the following are false statements about network troubleshooting tools?

    explanation: Session persistence (sticky sessions) ensures a user's requests go to the same server for session continuity.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)
  wrong:
  - answer: Load balancers always reduce network latency
    explanation: While load balancers can improve performance, they add a hop which may slightly increase latency.
  - answer: Only one load balancing algorithm exists
    explanation: Multiple algorithms exist including round-robin, least connections, IP hash, and weighted distributions.
  - answer: Load balancers can only distribute HTTP traffic
    explanation: Load balancers can distribute many protocols including HTTPS, TCP, UDP, and database connections.
  - answer: Load balancers require all backend servers to be identical
    explanation: While often similar, servers can have different capacities with weighted load balancing.
  - answer: Load balancers eliminate the need for redundancy
    explanation: Load balancers themselves need redundancy; they distribute load but don't eliminate the need for redundant infrastructure.

- question: Which of the following are false statements about cloud networking?

    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers
  - answer: The same port number can be used by both TCP and UDP
    explanation: TCP and UDP port spaces are independent; port 53 is used by both for DNS.
    links:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers
  - answer: SMTP uses port 25 for email transmission
    explanation: Port 25 is the standard port for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) email transfer.
