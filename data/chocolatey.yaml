  Chocolatey is a software installer that we'll need to install user-mode PowerShell (called "powershell.portable" or just "pwsh")
  in the event you cannot get your local PowerShell to run. Admin-mode PowerShell comes out of the box with Windows 10, but local execution policies prevent it from running.

  We also need PowerShell to install [scoop](/subjects/scoop).

  You probably won't need Chocolatey anymore since Scoop will solve most if not all of our needs, but there might be software that only Chocolatey can install that Scoop cannot.
