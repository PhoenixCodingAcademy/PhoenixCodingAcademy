  Chocolatey is a software installer that we'll need to install user-mode PowerShell (called "powershell.portable" or just "pwsh").
  Admin-mode PowerShell comes out of the box with Windows 10, but local execution policies prevent it from running.
  To install [scoop](/subjects/scoop), you must download a powershell script (`install.ps1`) and run that,
  which is why we need at least "powershell.portable". Once Chocolatey is installed and you use that to install "powershell.portable",
  you probably won't need Chocolatey anymore since Scoop will solve most if not all of our needs.
