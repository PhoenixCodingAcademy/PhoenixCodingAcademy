  PowerShell is Microsoft's version of the Linux Bash Shell.
  Your school might not let you run PowerShell because it has locked it down by restricting it in the Local Group Policy Editor or the Local Security Policy.
  Since you don't have elevated permissions, you cannot change this.
  This section is more for students with their own machines that does not have this locked down.
