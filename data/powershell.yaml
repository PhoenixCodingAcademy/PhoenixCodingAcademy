  PowerShell is Microsoft's version of the Linux Bash Shell.
  Your school might not let you run PowerShell because it has locked it down by restricting it in the Local Group Policy Editor or the Local Security Policy.
  Since you don't have elevated permissions, you cannot change this.
  This section is more for students with their own machines that does not have this locked down.

    ### Method 1
    First, let's see if you can actually run PowerShell:

    * WIN-Q, search "powershell"
    * Click "Windows PowerShell (x86)"
    * If you see a console window that reads "Windows PowerShell (x86)" where you can enter commands like "dir", then you have powershell installed.
    * Else continue with next method.

    ### Method 2
    Try this:
    * From the command console (cmd), run `%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
    * If that works, great. This is your new way to start a power shell.

    ### Method 3
    * WIN-Q, search "powershell"
    * See "Windows PowerShell (x86)" as an option
    * Expand the arrow to the right
    * Click "Open file location". If this doesn't exist, then try the next method.
    * Right click the "Windows PowerShell (x86)" link and select "Properties"
    * Copy the Target into the clipboard. It should be something like `"%windir%\...\PowerShell_ISE.exe"
    * Open a command console (cmd)
    * Paste that string into the window and hit ENTER
    * You might see a powershell window open up.
    * If instead, you just want the shell (without the window) then run the command above but remove the `_ISE` from the end.

    ### Method 4
    * If none of these methods work, then we have a final method.
    * Ensure you have [chocolatey](/subjects/chocolatey) installed.
    * From that folder, run "cmd" to get a command shell in that folder.
    * Run `choco install powershell.portable`
    * You should then be able to run PowerShell by typing `pwsh`
