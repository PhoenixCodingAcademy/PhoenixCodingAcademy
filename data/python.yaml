  Python is:

  * The most popular language taught in universities. According to [Google Searches for Tutorials](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) Python is now the most popular language in the world
    pushing Java into second place.
  * The #1 language to teach computer science. It used to be Pascal or C.
  * [Multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm), such as imperative, procedural, object oriented, functional
  * About 500,000 open source projects and libraries in Python available for free.
  * Recently surpassed R as the data science toolkit to know.
  * Used in machine learning and scientific research and simulation.

    title: For Linux (wsl, Ubuntu)
    prerequisites: wsl
    description: |
      You will get Python installed in your Linux environment, which we assume is WSL.
    steps: |
      Assuming you are at a Linux terminal, run:
      ```bash
      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
      sudo apt -y install python3.11
      -or-
      sudo apt -y install python3.11-full
      ```

      Run `python3.11 --version` to see the detailed version. This tells you that python 3.11 is installed.
      But we typically only want to use one version of python. The command `python` defaults to the 2.7 version, but that's
      so obsolete that we can forget about using it anymore.

      Run `python3 --version` to see the version. If you see a version other than 3.11,
      then you have two python 3 versions installed. If so, you can run  `which python3` to see which folder the
      python3 is in. Let's assume it returns `/usr/bin/python3`. Now type `ls -la /usr/bin | grep python`.
      This returns a list of files in that folder. Look for a lines like this (not necessarily in this order):

      ```
      -rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root      7134808 Jun  7 05:45 python3.11
      lrwxrwxrwx  1 root   root            9 Mar 13  2020 python3 -> python3.8
      ```

      The first line tells us that `python3.11` is installed.

      In the second line, the first letter `l` means hard link, and you'll see a ` -> ` in the description. It says that the command `python3`
      is pointing to `python3.8`.

      Regardless, we can create any aliases we want. Run `nano ~/.bash_aliases` to edit (or create) an aliases file.
      Add to this file, the following lines and save:
      ```
      alias python3=python3.11
      alias python=python3.11
      ```

      Now run `. ~/.bashrc` to reload that `~/.bashrc` file.

    acceptance: |
      Verify that python 3 is installed.

      * GIVEN I am at a Linux terminal
      * WHEN I run
      ```bash
      python --version
      -or-
      python3 --version
      ```
      * THEN I see:
      ```
      Python 3.11.4
      ```

      Python is great because there are 400,000 libraries out there that do just about everything you could want to do in Python.
      It is easy to create a new library for others to use.
      Learn:
      * What types of libraries are out there and how they are organized; e.g. games, math, databases,...
      * How to search for any existing library and how to install it.

        For the Data Science subject, many courses use Jupyter, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
        Here you install those libraries and then verify they work.
      steps: |
        ```
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          -> Python 3.11.0
        pip install jupyter scipy numpy pandas matplotlib gmpy2 pyyaml flask markdown

  prerequisites: InstallPython
  description: |
    In this course, you clone a repo that has a minecraft simulated environment written in Python using OpenGL.
    It's only about 1000 lines of code.

    ![minecraft](/static/images/minecraft.png)

    ## Steps

    ```dos
    c:
    cd \csc
    git clone https://github.com/robertscotthoward/minecraft.git
    cd minecraft
    pip install pyopengl pyglet==1.5.27
    python Minecraft.py
    ```

    This loads MyCode.py by default, but you can run other files by adding the name of the file to the command line; e.g.

    ```dos
    python Minecraft.py MyCodeLetters
    ```


    ## Hotkeys

    * `W`, `S`, `A`, `D` for standard Minecraft movement.
    * `1`, `2`, `3` to change the stone to place. There are only three types of blocks you can place in this demo.
    * `LEFT CLICK` remove a stone at the cursor.
    * `RIGHT CLICK` add a stone at the cursor.
    * Mouse to pan and scroll.
    * `TAB` toggle flying. When flying, just point in the air and move. No double-space click needed.
    * `SPACE` to jump.
    * `ESCAPE` to exit window.
    * `C` clear the board and reset.
    * `L` to reload the file. Expect a pause while rendering.
    * `H` to teleport back home; i.e. the default starting position and direction.
    * `M` generate hills. Expect a pause while rendering.
    * `R` same as these three key: `H` `C` `L`
    * `Q` quit.
