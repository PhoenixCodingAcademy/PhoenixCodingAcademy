    pushing Java into second place.

    title: For Linux (wsl, Ubuntu)
    prerequisites: wsl
    description: |
      You will get Python installed in your Linux environment, which we assume is WSL.
    steps: |
      Assuming you are at a Linux terminal, run:
      ```bash
      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
      sudo apt -y install python3.11
      -or-
      sudo apt -y install python3.11-full
      ```

      Run `python3.11 --version` to see the detailed version. This tells you that python 3.11 is installed.
      But we typically only want to use one version of python. The command `python` defaults to the 2.7 version, but that's
      so obsolete that we can forget about using it anymore.

      Run `python3 --version` to see the version. If you see a version other than 3.11,
      then you have two python 3 versions installed. If so, you can run  `which python3` to see which folder the
      python3 is in. Let's assume it returns `/usr/bin/python3`. Now type `ls -la /usr/bin | grep python`.
      This returns a list of files in that folder. Look for a lines like this (not necessarily in this order):

      ```
      -rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root      7134808 Jun  7 05:45 python3.11
      lrwxrwxrwx  1 root   root            9 Mar 13  2020 python3 -> python3.8
      ```

      The first line tells us that `python3.11` is installed.

      In the second line, the first letter `l` means hard link, and you'll see a ` -> ` in the description. It says that the command `python3`
      is pointing to `python3.8`.

      Regardless, we can create any aliases we want. Run `nano ~/.bash_aliases` to edit (or create) an aliases file.
      Add to this file, the following lines and save:
      ```
      alias python3=python3.11
      alias python=python3.11
      ```

      Now run `. ~/.bashrc` to reload that `~/.bashrc` file.

    acceptance: |
      Verify that python 3 is installed.

      * GIVEN I am at a Linux terminal
      * WHEN I run
      ```bash
      python --version
      -or-
      python3 --version
      ```
      * THEN I see:
      ```
      Python 3.11.4
      ```

      Python is great because there are 400,000 libraries out there that do just about everything you could want to do in Python.
      It is easy to create a new library for others to use.
      Learn:
      * What types of libraries are out there and how they are organized; e.g. games, math, databases,...
      * How to search for any existing library and how to install it.

        For the Data Science subject, many courses use Jupyter, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
        Here you install those libraries and then verify they work.
      steps: |
        ```
        pip install these libraries: jupyter scipy numpy pandas matplotlib
        ```
