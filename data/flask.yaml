  Flask is a powerful web framework that runs in Python.
  It is also easy to learn and similar to Node's [express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

  Some pluses to using Flask:

  * Since it's Python, you can capitalize on your current understanding to evolve the project.
  * For $5/month, you can deploy your application to https://pythonanywhere.com where it runs 24x7 in the public domain.
  * All the libraries that Python can access are at your disposal; e.g. Markdown, Matplotlib, Numpy, Jupyter, and Pandas.

purpose: |
  * Learn about programmatically generating HTML to make a dynamic interactive web site.
  * Use this site as a working example of what Flask can do.
