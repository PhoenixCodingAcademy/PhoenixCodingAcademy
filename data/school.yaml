    Much of the interesting software can be installed on your laptop without requiring admin permissions, if you know how.
    You are not bypassing the security of the laptop, but rather using a secondary approach, called the portable installation.
    Once installed, the software cannot perform elevated operations, but it can run its intended functions just for you.

  title: Cygwin
  short: The Cygwin unix-like environment that runs on Windows.
  parents: installers
  description: |
    Unix and Linux have produced so many great tool, like the GCC compiler, X Windows, Emacs, the Bash Shell, and all the free
    software that comes with it, that Cygwin was invented in the late 1990's to let Windows users capitalize on these tools. The
    alternative was to dual-boot Linux, or run it on another machine.

    This was so popular that Microsoft later created [WSL](/subjects/wsl) in 2016 to allow Windows users to use Linux while in
    Windows and without using a third-party hypervisor; e.g. VMWare, VirtualBox, or QEMU.
  purpose: |
    * Learn that such a tool exists.
    * Create an run a Hello World program in C or C++ or Fortran or Ada just to say that you did.
    * Learn a little about Bash tools, like grep, awk, and sed and why you might call yourself a real hacker if you know them.

    You'll get lots of math in your school, but this club concentrates on using computers to understand and solve problems.
    This subject is less about how to solve math problems and more about what types of problems are there that can make a
    business profitable, and what types of tools exist that can solve them.

    of computational mathematics1. MATLAB allows for matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of
    algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.
    It is widely used by engineers and scientists worldwide for a range of applications, including deep learning and machine learning,
    signal processing and communications, image and video processing, control systems, test and measurement, computational finance,
    and computational biology

      RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the R programming language, which is used for statistical computing and graphics.
      It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop, which is a regular desktop application, and RStudio Server, which runs on a remote server
      and allows access to RStudio using a web browser.
      RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history,
      debugging, and workspace management.
      It is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
      RStudio is widely used by data scientists and statisticians for developing statistical software and data analysis.
