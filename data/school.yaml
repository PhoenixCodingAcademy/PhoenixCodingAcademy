    Much of the interesting software can be installed on your laptop without requiring admin permissions, if you know how.
    You are not bypassing the security of the laptop, but rather using a secondary approach, called the portable installation.
    Once installed, the software cannot perform elevated operations, but it can run its intended functions just for you.

    You'll get lots of math in your school, but this club concentrates on using computers to understand and solve problems.
    This subject is less about how to solve math problems and more about what types of problems are there that can make a
    business profitable, and what types of tools exist that can solve them.

  short: |
    MATLAB is a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems and products.
    The heart of MATLAB is the MATLAB language, which is a matrix-based language that allows for the most natural expression
    of computational mathematics1. MATLAB allows for matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of
    algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.
    It is widely used by engineers and scientists worldwide for a range of applications, including deep learning and machine learning,
    signal processing and communications, image and video processing, control systems, test and measurement, computational finance,
    and computational biology

      prerequisites: wsl
      description: |
        You will get Python installed in your Linux environment, which we assume is WSL.
      steps: |
        Assuming you are at a Linux terminal, run:
        ```bash
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
        sudo apt -y install python3.11
        -or-
        sudo apt -y install python3.11-full
        ```

        Run `python3.11 --version` to see the detailed version. This tells you that python 3.11 is installed.
        But we typically only want to use one version of python. The command `python` defaults to the 2.7 version, but that's
        so obsolete that we can forget about using it anymore.

        Run `python3 --version` to see the version. If you see a version other than 3.11,
        then you have two python 3 versions installed. If so, you can run  `which python3` to see which folder the
        python3 is in. Let's assume it returns `/usr/bin/python3`. Now type `ls -la /usr/bin | grep python`.
        This returns a list of files in that folder. Look for a lines like this (not necessarily in this order):

        ```
        -rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root      7134808 Jun  7 05:45 python3.11
        lrwxrwxrwx  1 root   root            9 Mar 13  2020 python3 -> python3.8
        ```

        The first line tells us that `python3.11` is installed.

        In the second line, the first letter `l` means hard link, and you'll see a ` -> ` in the description. It says that the command `python3`
        is pointing to `python3.8`.

        Regardless, we can create any aliases we want. Run `nano ~/.bash_aliases` to edit (or create) an aliases file.
        Add to this file, the following lines and save:
        ```
        alias python3=python3.11
        alias python=python3.11
        ```

        Now run `. ~/.bashrc` to reload that `~/.bashrc` file.

      acceptance: |
        Verify that python 3 is installed.

        * GIVEN I am at a Linux terminal
        * WHEN I run

        * What types of libraries are out there and how they are organized; e.g. games, math, databases,...
        * How to search for any existing library and how to install it.
