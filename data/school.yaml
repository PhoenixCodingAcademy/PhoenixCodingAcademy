    Much of the interesting software can be installed on your laptop without requiring admin permissions, if you know how.
    You are not bypassing the security of the laptop, but rather using a secondary approach, called the portable installation.
    Once installed, the software cannot perform elevated operations, but it can run its intended functions just for you.

    This section assumes that you have permissions to install WSL.
    Your school might not allow it on their machines (e.g a laptop you are borrowing) since it can allow you to bypass
    tbe Windows Firewall in clever ways. But for you own machines at home, or your own personal device, WSL can get you started
    in Linux very quickly.

  title: Mathematics
  short: |
    Mathematics is very interesting and fun if you do it right.
    All university science majors and engineering professions require it as the language.
    You'll get lots of math in your school, but this club concentrates on using computers to understand and solve problems.
    This subject is less about how to solve math problems and more about what types of problems are there that can make a
    business profitable, and what types of tools exist that can solve them.

- id: sagemath
  title: SageMath
  parents: math
  short: |
    System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation is a free application that can solve problems as well as Mathematica.
    No only can it give you the number to a solution, it can give your function that solves a Calculus problem.

- id: matlab
  title: MATLAB
  parents: math
  short: |
    MATLAB is a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems and products.
    The heart of MATLAB is the MATLAB language, which is a matrix-based language that allows for the most natural expression
    of computational mathematics1. MATLAB allows for matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of
    algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.
    It is widely used by engineers and scientists worldwide for a range of applications, including deep learning and machine learning,
    signal processing and communications, image and video processing, control systems, test and measurement, computational finance,
    and computational biology

      RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the R programming language, which is used for statistical computing and graphics.
      It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop, which is a regular desktop application, and RStudio Server, which runs on a remote server
      and allows access to RStudio using a web browser.
      RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history,
      debugging, and workspace management.
      It is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
