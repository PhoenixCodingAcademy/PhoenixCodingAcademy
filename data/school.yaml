    Much of the interesting software can be installed on your laptop without requiring admin permissions, if you know how.
    You are not bypassing the security of the laptop, but rather using a secondary approach, called the portable installation.
    Once installed, the software cannot perform elevated operations, but it can run its intended functions just for you.

    The general strategy is to create a root subfolder for you; e.g. `C:\sofia` (called the "app folder") and then add all your portable software there.

    An alternative strategy is to install [scoop](/subjects/scoop) or [chocolatey](/subjects/chocolatey) or both
    to make installing software very easy. Winget requires admin permissions and so we'll ignore it. Some decisions facts:
    * Chocolatey tends to require more admin permissions and PowerShell
    * Scoop installs more to user folders.

      Character recognition is a classic pattern recognition problem for which researchers have worked since the early days of computer vision.
      With today's omnipresence of cameras, the applications of automatic character recognition are broader than ever.
      For Latin script, this is largely considered a solved problem in constrained situations,
      such as images of scanned documents containing common character fonts and uniform background.
      However, images obtained with popular cameras and hand held devices still pose a formidable challenge for character recognition.
      The challenging aspects of this problem are evident in this dataset.

      It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop, which is a regular desktop application, and RStudio Server, which runs on a remote server
      and allows access to RStudio using a web browser.
      RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history,
      debugging, and workspace management.
      It is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
      RStudio is widely used by data scientists and statisticians for developing statistical software and data analysis.

    I've once heard that an "Engineer" is a "Scientist" plus an "Economist".
    $$Engineer = Scientist + Economist$$
    As a scientist, you find solutions to physical problems.
    As an economist, you optimize the solutions to minimize cost.
