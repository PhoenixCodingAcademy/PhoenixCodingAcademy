  short: Build a network in class with your team mates. It might already be done for you.

    Our computer lab has many desktop computers, each connected to a router. Therefore, each has a unique IP address and optionally
    a human-readable computer name associated with it.

    title: You, the server.
    short: Prove that your desktop really is a network node and can act as a server.
    description: |
      Find a desktop that is connected to the network, or ideally a wireless router.
      That's your server. You are part of the network. The only thing that separates a "server" from a "desktop" or "laptop"
      is how humans physically interact with it.

      * **desktop** - it sits on a desk, or under it, and might use WiFi, but might have a cable.
      * **laptop** - it sits on your lap and most likely connects to the network with WiFi.
      * **server** - it might not have a keyboard, display, or mouse, and you might leave it on all the time, and it might be expensive.

      Seriously, these are all computers and they are connected to the network via TCP/IP. Therefore, we have ourselves a network.

      The lab does have an expensive machine in the cabinet (we call a server) and a bunch of desktops, but they all do the same thing.
      We might as well be talking about trucks, cars, vans, and 18-wheelers. They all drive on the road and move things.

      In this assignment, determine your server's unique identity. We'll assume you are a Windows desktop.

      ## Step 1

      Run this:

      ```
      ipconfig /all
      ```

      It might show you a bunch of sections, one for each network adapter you have. Look for the one that contains **Default Gateway**.
      That is the adapter that is actually connected to the network. It might look like this:

      ```
      Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:

        Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1

        NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled
      ```
      The **IPv4 Address** address (ex: **192.168.1.2**) is unique to your machine. Another computer on the same network will have
      a different IP address.

      ## Step 2

      Run:
      ```
      echo %COMPUTERNAME%
      ```

      This will show you your computer name. This does not have to be unique, but it would be confusing otherwise. So they typically
      are unique. They exist to help humans.

      ## Step 3

      Find your neighbors IP address (call it NEIGHBORIP). Then run:
      ```
      ping NEIGHBORIP
      ```

      Hopefully you don't see "Request timed out" or "Destination host unreachable."
      You should be able to see a TTL (Time To Live) of some number.

      ## Step 4

      To see all the computers on your network, run:
      ```
      net view
      ```
      ## Step 5

      Pick any computer (e.g. ANYNAME) and run:
      ```
      ping ANYNAME
      ```

      This is just another way to ping a machine - by name instead of IP address.

    acceptance: |
      * You shared your IP address with another user, and vice versa.
      * You ping'ed another machine.
      * You know your computer name.
      * You know the names of other machines.

    title: Create Web Server
    short: Run a web site on your server that someone else can hit
    description: |
      Your desktop machine is on the network. So you should be able to make your own web server that serves up your web content
      for others on the network to see.

      A **web site** can be little more than a folder with one "index.html" file in it, and served up by a programmed called a web server.
      So let's do that.

      ## Step 1 - create web site folder

      * Create a folder (e.g. "MyWebSite")
      * Use some file editor (e.g. Notepad or Visual Code) to create a file named `index.html` and add some text to it. Maybe HTML like this:

      ```html
      <h1>My Web Site</h1>
      Welcome.
      ```

      ## Step 2 - start web server

      * Open the command console and change to that folder.
      * Assuming you have Python 3 installed, run this command:

      ```
      python -m http.server
      ```

      ## Step 3 - open web site in browser

      Then open this URL in your browser: http://localhost:8000

      ## Options

      Then try these URLs. They are different ways to do the same thing:

      * http://192.168.0.1:8000/
      * http://COMPUTERNAME:8000/

      If you want to specify another folder (rather than the one the server is running in), or change the port:
      ```
      python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory /path/to/your/folder
      ```
