  Scoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It:

  * Eliminates permission popup windows
  * Hides GUI wizard-style installers
  * Prevents PATH pollution from installing lots of programs
  * Avoids unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
  * Finds and installs dependencies automatically
  * Performs all the extra setup steps itself to get a working program

  The apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files
  that run stand-alone when extracted and don't have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files
  outside the program directory.

    You have a school laptop, and it's all locked down. You want to install scoop but supposedly this requires elevated permissions.
    First determine if it is already installed.

    * Create a folder for scoop; e.g. `C:\john\scoop`
    * Start Powershell
    * Run `cd C:\john\scoop`
    * Run `irm get.scoop.sh -outfile 'install.ps1'
    * Run `.\install.ps1 -?`
    * Run `.\install.ps1 -ScoopDir 'C:\john\scoop' -ScoopGlobalDir 'C:\john\scoop' -NoProxy`

    If your machine does not allow PowerShell to run, then you'll need to install the portable version of PowerShell.
