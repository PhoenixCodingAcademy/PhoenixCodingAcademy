  Scoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It:

  * Eliminates permission popup windows
  * Hides GUI wizard-style installers
  * Prevents PATH pollution from installing lots of programs
  * Avoids unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
  * Finds and installs dependencies automatically
  * Performs all the extra setup steps itself to get a working program

  The apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files
  that run stand-alone when extracted and don't have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files
  outside the program directory.

    You have a school laptop, and it's all locked down. You want to install scoop but supposedly this requires elevated permissions.
    First determine if it is already installed.

    * Create a folder for scoop off your apps folder; e.g. `C:\sofia\scoop`
    * Set environment variable "SCOOP" to point to that scoop folder; e.g. `set SCOOP=C:\sofia\scoop`
    * Start [Powershell](/subjects/powershell)
    * Run `cd C:\sofia\scoop`
    * Run `irm get.scoop.sh | iex`
    * This should automatically create the necessary files in the scoop folder.
    * VERIFY: you have `C:\sofia\scoop\shims` in your environment path files.
    * Reopen your command shell and type `scoop`. You should see:
    ```dos
    Usage: scoop <command> [<args>]
    ...
    ```
    * Otherwise, something is not set up. Retrace your steps.

  Alternatively:
    * Run `irm get.scoop.sh -outfile 'install.ps1'
    * Run `.\install.ps1 -?`
    * Run `.\install.ps1 -ScoopDir 'C:\sofia\scoop' -ScoopGlobalDir 'C:\sofia\scoop' -NoProxy`
