  Unix and Linux have produced so many great tool, like the GCC compiler, X Windows, Emacs, the Bash Shell, and all the free
  software that comes with it, that Cygwin was invented in the late 1990's to let Windows users capitalize on these tools. The
  alternative was to dual-boot Linux, or run it on another machine.

  This was so popular that Microsoft later created [WSL](/subjects/wsl) in 2016 to allow Windows users to use Linux while in
  Windows and without using a third-party hypervisor; e.g. VMWare, VirtualBox, or QEMU.

purpose: |
  * Learn that such a tool exists.
  * Create an run a Hello World program in C or C++ or Fortran or Ada just to say that you did.
  * Learn a little about Bash tools, like grep, awk, and sed and why you might call yourself a real hacker if you know them.

      * Create a folder named "Cygwin" in your APPS folder.
      * Go to https://www.cygwin.com/
      * Click link "Install Cygwin by running setup-x86_64.exe"
      * Save the "setup-x86_64.exe" file in your "Cygwin" folder
      * Run that exe. If it requires you to have admin permissions, then instead:
        * Start a command prompt in that folder
        * Run `setup-x86_64 --no-admin`
      * Choose "Install from Internet"
      * Set your Root Directory to your "Cygwin" folder; e.g. `C:\Sofia\Cygwin`
      * Choose "Install for just me"
      * Next
      * Set your Local Package Directory to your "Cygwin" folder; e.g. `C:\Sofia\Cygwin`
      * Next, Direct Connection
      * Next, Choose any mirror that sounds good.
      * Next, and wait for it to download all the package references.
      * When finished, you should see a list of things you can install in a window titled "Cygwin Setup - Select Packages". A package is an application you can install.
      * Choose View = "Full" to see all the packages.

      Install a Package (or app):

        * From [the previous assignment](/assignments/cygwin_basics_1), you see the "Cygwin Setup - Select Packages" window.
        * Suppose you want to play with the Common Lisp language.
        * Search for "lisp"
        * See package "clisp" appear.
        * In the "New" column, you can choose "Install"
        * Select "Next" at the bottom to install this package.
        * When finished, you can close the setup window.

      Run the app:

        * From the Cygwin folder, run the "Cygwin.bat" file to get a BASH shell terminal.
        * Type "clisp" to run the Common LISP [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).
        * You should see `[1]>`
        * Type in there `(+ 23 45 9 -3)`
        * GET `74` because that's the sum of those 4 numbers.
        * LISP works.
        * Type `(quit)` to exit.
        * You can learn more about this language in [LISP](/subjects/lisp)

      Additional commands:

        * Type `apt-cyg show clisp` to see information about the clisp package.

      There is a nice application called [apt-cyg](https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg) that can allow you to install
      applications (or packages) from the BASH shell. But you need to install it.

      * Start the BASH shell (i.e. run the "Cygwin.bat") program.
      * Run `wget rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg`
      * Run `install apt-cyg /bin`

      At this point, you should be able to install a package from the command line. Let's find out.

      * Suppose you want to install the [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) text editor. This editor appears on most Linux distros.
      * Type `apt-cyg searchall nano` to see all the packages that have some relation to nano.
      * You can see that `nano` appears in the list.
      * Type `nano` at the terminal.
      * If something loads up, then you know it's already installed. Hit CTRL-X to quit.
      * Otherwise, you could just type `apt-cyg install nano`
      * Type `nano myfile.txt` at the terminal.
      * Enter some text, like "Once upon a time..."
      * Type CTRL-X, Y, ENTER to save this file.
      * You should be out of the editor and back to the terminal.
      * Type `ls -la`. You should see something like this below with `myfile.txt` in the list.
      * You just created a file. Type `nano myfile.txt` to edit it again if you want to make changes and save it.
