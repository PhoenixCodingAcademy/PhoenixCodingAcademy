  I love using Visual Studio 2002 for .NET Development and C++, but if I had to choose exactly one editor to use for the rest of my life,
  it would be Visual Code (or VS Code or just Code). With this tool, I can literally do everything. It is practically its own operating system,
  much like Emacs used to claim decades ago. This entire site was built solely in VS Code - the Python Flask web site, HTML, CSS, (not much JavaScript),
  Markdown, YAML, and Git.

  It has these modern features:

  * Intellisense
  * Huge ever-growing number of extensions that can do anything you want.
  * Support for all languages; Python, Go, C, C++, C#, Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, LaTeX, Markdown, ... you name it.
  * Built-in debugging hooks; run and hit breakpoints.
  * Built-in Git workflow. Commit, Push, create Pull Requests, Rebase, ...
  * Free and Open-Source. Tons of code on GitHub. Incredible documentation. ChatGPT knows it well.
  * Can install in user mode, without admin permissions.
  * Cross platform: Windows, Linux, Max, Raspberry Pi


purpose: |

  * Install VS Code in user-mode so you can add any extension without consulting an administrator.
  * Know the primary productive tricks for getting things done.
  * Learn how to create these types of artifacts:
    * Web pages
    * Python Program
    * Markdown Documents and Books
    * Configuration Files: YAML, JSON, XML, INI
    * PDF Files
    * Mermaid Diagrams - create
  * Search, install, configure, and use plug-ins - this is actually quite easy.
  * Customize VS Code
