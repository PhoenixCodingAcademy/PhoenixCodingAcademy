  Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a British mathematician, logician, and a major contributor to mathematics, cryptanalysis,
  computer science, and artificial intelligence1.
  He invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles
  of the digital computer.
  Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages during World War II, enabling the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements.

  Alan invented the concept of a "Turing Machine", which is an abstract definition of computation.
  A machine or programming language is said to be **Turing Complete** (or a **Universal Turing Machine**) if every possible programming language or application can be written
  in it.

  Some interesting Turing Complete machines:

  * [Conway's Game of Life](https://conwaylife.com/)
  * [Magic the Gathering Card Game](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/its-possible-to-build-a-turing-machine-within-magic-the-gathering/)
  * The [NAND Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate). By repeating this simple logical gate,
    you can create any other logic gate, and thus any computer in the world.
    In fact, [NAND to TETRIS](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is a complete online
    digital computer class where you create a working computer that plays TETRIS from just composing NAND gates.
    There is a free [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) class on it as well as on
    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzy0RG9Z1Ak).
* The [Busy Beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver) is turing complete.

    Not the most politely named programming language, but it does exist in Repl.it and you can quickly get an idea of what
    such a programming language looks like.

    It is possible to build a computer with just one instruction, typically with three parameters.
    Here is a list of many such computers that have been proven to be Turing Complete.

  text: Is the NAND gate logical complete?
  short: |
    The NAND gate has the property of functional completeness, which it shares with the NOR gate.
    That is, any other logic function (AND, OR, etc.) can be implemented using only NAND gates.
    NAND and NOR are called a "Universal Gate" for just this reason.

    An Oracle is a mythical, hypothetical computer that can instantly answer a YES or NO question in any context.
    It is used in proofs of certain types of theoretical computing; e.g. cryptography.
