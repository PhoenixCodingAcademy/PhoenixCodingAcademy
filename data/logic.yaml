  Computers, CPUs, and logic circuits are a [IPO](/pages/IPO.md) graphs of logic gates, e.g. AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, ...
  The The [NAND Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate) is [Turing Complete](/subjects/turingmachines), which means you
  can create any computer in the world with just NAND gates. To prove this fact, a couple of smart computer professors
  (Nisan and Schocken) wrote a course called [NAND to TETRIS](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). This is a complete online
  digital computer class where you create a working computer that plays TETRIS from just composing NAND gates.
  There is a free [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) class on it as well as on
  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzy0RG9Z1Ak).

  title: NAND 2 TETRIS
  description: |
    Build a complete working computer from just NAND gates. You don't need a soldering iron or electronic parts.
    This is all done in a web-based [IDE](/subjects/editors) that you can also download and work in. See [WEB IDE](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/chip/).
    It completely simulates the computer
    using a language called Hardware Definition Language (HDL). AFter the language is written, it is easy to send it to a
    Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which is a circuit that will run your code. HDL can also be burned on an
    Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chip.
