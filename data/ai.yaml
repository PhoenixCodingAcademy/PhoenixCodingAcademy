  Artificial Intelligence is a broad category of these subjects:

  # AI Roadmap

  It should be obvious that learning AI is mainly about the amount of time you spend exposing yourself to AI lectures, books and blogs.


  # YouTube Videos and Playlists

  If a picture paints a thousand words, then a video paints a thousand pictures.
  Some of the best illustrations and explanations of hard concepts are done on YouTube.
  Here are some great (and free) playlists to understanding AI that you can subscribe to:

  ## Mathematics
  Understanding chemistry and thermodynamics is required to understand how cars work, but not required to drive a car.
  Mathematics is required to understand AI and LLM algorithms, but not required to use AI or understand its use cases.

  If you wish to understand the innards of AI, focus on
  * **Linear algebra**: Neural networks are heavily reliant on matrix operations, such as multiplication and addition, to process and transform data. Understanding matrices, vectors, and their properties is essential for grasping how AI models represent and manipulate data.
  * **Calculus**: Particularly differentiation, as back propagation—the process through which neural networks learn—relies on gradients to adjust weights. Gradient descent methods, including variations like stochastic gradient descent, are fundamental for optimization.
  * **Probability, and Statistics**: These are crucial for understanding uncertainty in data and model predictions. They form the backbone of concepts like Bayesian inference, probabilistic modeling, and evaluating AI model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, and recall).
