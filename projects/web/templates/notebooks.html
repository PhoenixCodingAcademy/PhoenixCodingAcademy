<h1>Jupyter Notebooks</h1>
These notebooks are saved in the `projects/notebooks` folder where they can be tested locally by running `jupyter notebook` in that folder.
Once deployed to the server, they appear here below, where Google will run them for us in a safe sandbox environment. Thanks Google.
I wonder how long that will be free to the public?

Here are some Jupyter Notebooks created as examples just for this club.
You can change any to play around, but you cannot save them.
Click any to show them. Hit **CTRL-F9** to run them if needed.
