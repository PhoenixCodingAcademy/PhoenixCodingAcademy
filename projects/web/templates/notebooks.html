<h1>Jupyter Notebooks</h1>
These notebooks are saved in the `projects/notebooks` folder where they can be tested locally by running `jupyter notebook` in that folder.
Once deployed to the server, they appear here below, where Google will run them for us in a safe sandbox environment. Thanks Google.
I wonder how long that will be free to the public?
