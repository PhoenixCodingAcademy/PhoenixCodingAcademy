<h1>YAML</h1>

This web site is data-driven by a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> files.
YAML is like JSON, but easier to read and write. Change this single file to add content to this site.
You don't need to know how the data is converted into HTML. The web application does all that for you.
