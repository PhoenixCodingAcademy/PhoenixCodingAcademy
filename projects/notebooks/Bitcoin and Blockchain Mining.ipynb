    "# How hashing does bitcoin mining\n",
    "\n",
    "[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) uses 2 rounds of SHA-256 hashing to create its blockchains. In this page, we will do rudimentary block chains and hashing to get an idea of how the big picture works.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"blockchain\" is a chain of blocks. Duh! So what is a \"block\" and what is a \"chain\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "As per [what is a block](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-bitcoin-block.asp), a block is an array of bytes (can be a string) that contains:\n",
    "* ID of previous block.\n",
    "* A nonce, or \"number used just once\" (in this case an integer)\n",
    "* The size of a block. We'll just make it any size.\n",
    "* [A Merkle Hash Root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)\n"
