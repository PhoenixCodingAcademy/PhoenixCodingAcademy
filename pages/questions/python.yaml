questions:
- question: What are examples of declarative programming in Python?
  right:
  - answer: numpy
    explanation: |
      With the numpy library, you can declare an array of objects, like integers, reals, or complex numbers.
      From multiple arrays, you can "multiply" them together by just using the "*" operator.
      You don't care how numpy performs the multiplication behind the scene; only that it returns the correct answer.
  - answer: sympy
    explanation: |
      SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics that can be used in a declarative style.
      SymPy allows you to specify mathematical expressions and equations using a natural, human-readable syntax,
      and then it automatically performs the necessary computations to solve or simplify the expressions.

      You can use SymPy to solve algebraic equations, compute derivatives and integrals, and perform matrix operations, all using a declarative syntax.
      This allows you to focus on describing the problem you want to solve, rather than worrying about the details of how to perform the computations.
      In summary, SymPy is a powerful tool for declarative programming in Python, allowing you to perform complex mathematical computations using a simple, readable syntax. Is there anything else you would like to know?

  wrong:
  - answer: SQL
    explanation: |
      SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative language used for managing and querying relational databases.
      It is not specific to Python, but it can be used in conjunction with Python through libraries such as sqlite3, psycopg2, or MySQLdb to interact with databases.

      In SQL, you write statements that describe the data you want to retrieve or manipulate, and the database management system figures out the best way to execute your query.
      For example, you can use a SELECT statement to specify the columns and rows you want to retrieve from a table, and the database management system will determine the most efficient way to access the data.
  - answer: Functions
    explanation: Functions are imperative where you explicitly tell the machine how to solve a problem.
  - answer: Creating classes, constructors, and method
    explanation: These are examples of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not the declarative programming paradigm.
