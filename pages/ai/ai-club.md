# Phoenix Coding Academy A.I. Club

Join the Phoenix AI Innovators Club and explore the exciting frontier of artificial intelligence! In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, the traditional notion of "coding" is shifting. Just as calculators transformed arithmetic, AI is revolutionizing software creation. We'll delve into the world of prompt engineering, where crafting effective instructions for AI models is becoming the key skill, and even explore the rise of "vibe coders" who leverage AI to bring their visions to life. Forget endless lines of manual code - we'll focus on understanding AI's potential, experimenting with cutting-edge tools, and developing the skills to harness this powerful technology for innovation and creation, much like we now rely on computers instead of manual long division.

Imagine someone asks you to create a static website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that pulls data directly from your Google Sheet, is deployed automatically to the web when you push the changes to Github, and is served for free on the web. The site prints the data in a sortable, searchable table and displays statistics with various charts from [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/).

**Imagine that you could create this entire working site in 15 minutes using AI techniques!**

Here's a quick example of something created in about that time: https://github.com/PhoenixCodingAcademy/example1

There has never been a more fun and exciting time to learn engineering, computers, and robotics since ChatGPT was released to the public in November 2022.

# Projects

Here are some other engaging project ideas for high schoolers, spanning various interests and skill levels:


## Web Development & Interactive Experiences:

* Personal Portfolio Website: Students can showcase their skills, projects, and interests in a visually appealing and interactive way. They can learn about web design principles, responsive layouts, and even add animations.
* Interactive Quiz or Game: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, students can create fun quizzes on their favorite subjects or simple web-based games. This teaches them about logic, user interaction, and event handling.
* Dynamic To-Do List or Note-Taking App: Building a functional web application helps students understand data management, user input, and updating the user interface in real-time (potentially using local storage or a simple backend).
* "Choose Your Own Adventure" Story: This combines creative writing with web development, allowing students to build interactive narratives with branching storylines.
* Recipe Website with Filtering: Students can collect their favorite recipes and build a website that allows users to filter by ingredients, cuisine, or dietary restrictions.


## Data & Visualization:

* Personal Finance Tracker: Students can learn about budgeting and data analysis by building a simple web app or spreadsheet that tracks their income and expenses, with charts to visualize their spending habits.
* Sports Statistics Dashboard: For sports enthusiasts, they can gather data on their favorite teams or players and create a visual dashboard using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.
* Weather Data Visualization: Students can learn to fetch weather data from APIs and display it in an informative and visually appealing way on a website.
* Social Media Sentiment Analysis (Simplified): Using basic Python and text processing, students can analyze the sentiment of tweets or other text data related to a topic they're interested in.
* Show geo data in a map over the world or country.


## Robotics & Physical Computing (Beyond First Robotics):

* Smart Home Automation Project: Using platforms like Arduino or Raspberry Pi, students can build projects that automate tasks like controlling lights, monitoring temperature, or even a simple security system.
* Line-Following Robot: This classic robotics project teaches fundamental concepts of sensors, motors, and control algorithms.
* Interactive Art Installation: Combining sensors, microcontrollers, and creative materials, students can build art pieces that respond to user interaction or environmental stimuli.
* Weather Station: Building a small weather station that collects data (temperature, humidity, pressure) and displays it on a small screen or sends it to a web server.


## Game Development:

* Simple 2D Platformer: Using game development libraries like Pygame (Python) or Phaser (JavaScript), students can learn the basics of game loops, collision detection, and character movement.
* Text-Based Adventure Game: This focuses on storytelling and logic, and can be built using Python or even simple web technologies.
* Godot Development: publish your game on Steam for others to pay to play.


## AI & Machine Learning (Introductory):

* Image Recognition with Teachable Machine: Google's Teachable Machine allows students to train simple image, audio, or pose recognition models without writing code.
* Basic Chatbot: Using platforms like Dialogflow (Google Cloud) or Rasa, students can build simple chatbots for specific tasks.
* Predictive Text Generator: Using basic Python and natural language processing concepts, students can create a program that suggests the next word based on previous input.


## Creative & Multimedia:

* Stop-Motion Animation Movie: Students can learn about storytelling, visual composition, and animation techniques.
* Podcast or Radio Play: This project focuses on audio production, scripting, and storytelling through sound.
* Digital Art or Animation Portfolio: Students can showcase their creative work online using a website they build themselves.


## Tips for Making Projects Fun and Engaging:

* Student-Driven Interests: Encourage students to choose projects based on their passions.
* Real-World Applications: Highlight how the skills they learn can be applied to solve real problems or create useful tools.
* Collaboration: Allow students to work in teams to foster communication and shared learning.
* Showcasing and Sharing: Provide opportunities for students to present their projects to their peers, teachers, and even the wider community.
* Iterative Development: Encourage experimentation, failure as a learning opportunity, and continuous improvement.
