* Base page template (the banner) now has searching capability. Uses [Jaro-Winkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance) to create a scoring method to return best matching pages first, and correct for spelling mistakes in the search terms. Index.py is run to create the `index.txt` file, which contains the page index.
* This "history" page introduced.
* Discord Server added for the club.

[MEETING LINK](https://github.com/orgs/PhoenixCodingAcademy/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=46135093)

Attendance: Howard, Andrews, Masamery - Robby, Genny, Tommy, Cole, and Israel.

New Remote Members: Dagny Howard, Angel Castaneda

Everyone:

* Learned about [JupyterLite](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) and that it uses WebAssembly (WASM) to let the clients perform all CPU execution, and how it integrates with all the latest browsers.
* Saw a few examples for [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) - Angular and HTML.
* Discussed the Low [Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) since it came up from a question about StackBlitz, and how it should be the target of any compiler written these days, if any student is every interested in build their own programming language.
* Cloned the [Minecraft Python Simulator](https://github.com/robertscotthoward/minecraft) including new member Israel, who was bootstrapped into the club very quickly. This is 500 lines of python code that simulate a Minecraft world. There are no mobs and weather. Only 4 types of blocks exists, but you can very easily write Python code to place the blocks anywhere in the world, and then you can (in 3D) fly through your creation. This code was written to teach students how to use Python with 3D coordinates.

Also

* Mr. Andrews got Israel added to the membership so that means I official have backup. Ms. Masamery is next to add a new member, when we get one.
* [Membership Process](http://phoenixcodingacademy.pythonanywhere.com/pages/MembershipProcess.md) page written
