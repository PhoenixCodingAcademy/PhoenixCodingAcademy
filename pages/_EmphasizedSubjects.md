# Primary Subjects

As the [subjects page](/subjects) page shows, there are a lot of subjects that can be topics of our weekly club.
As a participant, you might want to add your own to the list, and define courses, assignments, and questions to test one's knowledge.
In order to do so, you will need to know how to add content. This page discusses the main subjects that you'll want to dive into earlier in order to update content on this website.

Here is a suggested curriculum of subjects that will help you achieve the title of "content author" for this club:

* [Git Version Control](/subjects/git) - you'll need to know the basics of Git and Github to pull down the project to your local machine and run the web site there.
  * [Clone the repo](course/Git_CloneWebRepo) - learn how to pull a copy of the code to your laptop so you can run it there.
