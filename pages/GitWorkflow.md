# Git Workflow

**Git**, a free and open source version control system ([VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)), is the most popular one world-wide. If you don't know Git, you won't last long in the software field. Git is so useful that authors often use it create books, and professional use it as their resume.

Many tutorials say that "Git track changes to code." True, but it's even better to say that Git tracks changes to text files - code is just one type of text file, but even binary files can be stored in Git. Anything you can put in a text file, you can (and should) track in Git.

You do not need a Git account to use Git. If you have one, you can push your changes off your computer to the cloud to back it up (in case your laptop breaks), or to share with others, but Git is useful even for a single person. You make mistakes. You might need to roll them back to a working version. You need to see a history of what you did over the months. You might later want to share it. So if you are going to create anything in text files stored in a folder, then put git in there.

This course will use Git to manage all users
