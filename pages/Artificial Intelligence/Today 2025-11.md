## Real Reason for AI Layoffs

[Companies Are Blaming AI for Layoffs. The Real Reason Will Piss You Off - Jari Mattlar (Oct 25, 2025)](https://medium.com/@mattlar.jari/companies-are-blaming-ai-for-layoffs-the-real-reason-will-piss-you-off-149639ce47cf)

Main Points:

**The Core Deception:**
- 180,000 tech workers were laid off in 2025, with companies blaming AI automation
- MIT study reveals **95% of companies investing in AI see zero ROI**
- Oxford researchers say companies are "scapegoating" AI to hide traditional cost-cutting

**The Reality Behind "AI Layoffs":**
- Only 1% of service firms actually laid off workers due to AI (down from 10% last year)
- Companies are using "AI transformation" as PR cover for:
  - Pandemic-era overhiring corrections
  - Routine cost-cutting to boost quarterly earnings
  - Poor growth forecasting from 2020-2021

**Notable Examples of Misleading Claims:**
- **Klarna**: Cut 40% of workforce, CEO later admitted "0 layoffs due to AI" (natural attrition)
- **Salesforce**: Cut 4,000 jobs blaming AI, but actually "redeployed" workers internally
- **IBM & Klarna**: Both reversed AI customer service initiatives after failures, had to rehire

**What Studies Actually Show:**
- Yale study: No widespread AI-driven job displacement detected
- MIT study: AI tools "fail to contribute to profits due to brittle workflows"
- Companies waste money on low-ROI AI applications instead of effective automation

**Who's Really Hurt:**
- Entry-level workers (ages 22-25) saw 13% decline in job opportunities
- AI handles repetitive tasks, eliminating traditional career entry points
- Workload redistributed to remaining overworked employees rather than actually automated

**The Bottom Line:**
AI isn't advanced enough to replace most jobs, but "AI" makes a convenient excuse for layoffs that were planned for other reasons—making CEOs look innovative rather than incompetent.

## Your Entry-Level Job is Disappearing Faster Than You Think

[I Analyzed 76,000 AI Job Losses in 2025 — Your Entry-Level Job is Disappearing Faster Than You Think - Jari Mattlar (Oct 31, 2025)](https://medium.com/@mattlar.jari/i-analyzed-76-000-ai-job-losses-in-2025-your-entry-level-job-is-disappearing-faster-than-you-b801a71d50dd)

Main Points:

**The Scale of Displacement:**
- 76,440 workers lost jobs to AI in 2025 (through October)
- 40% of employers expect to reduce workforce where AI can automate tasks
- Nearly 50 million US jobs at risk, with 92 million projected displaced by 2030

**Entry-Level Jobs Are Primary Targets:**
- AI can replace **53% of market research analyst tasks** and **67% of sales rep tasks**
- Managerial roles only 9-21% automation risk
- Big Tech reduced new graduate hiring by **25% in 2024** vs 2023
- Workers aged 18-24 are **129% more likely** than those over 65 to worry about AI job obsolescence

**The Education Trap:**
- 49% of Gen Z job hunters believe AI has reduced their college degree's value
- 77% of NEW AI jobs require master's degrees
- Bachelor's-level jobs being eliminated while requiring MORE education to compete for remaining positions

**Jobs at Critical Risk (2025-2027):**
- Customer service reps: 80% automation rate
- Data entry clerks: 7.5 million jobs eliminated
- Retail cashiers: 65% automation risk
- Market research analysts, sales reps, legal researchers

**The Remote Work Paradox:**
- Only 11% of AI job openings are fully remote
- Remote positions are EASIEST to automate (already digital workflows)
- 74% of AI jobs require on-site presence

**Key Data Points:**
- 37% of companies (2023) → 44% (2024) say employees will be laid off due to AI
- AI chatbots save businesses $8 billion annually
- Microsoft: 30% of code is now AI-written; 40% of recent layoffs targeted software engineers
- IBM's AI system handles 11.5 million HR interactions with minimal human oversight

**Survival Strategies Recommended:**
1. **Specialize in AI-resistant work**: Physical presence, complex human interaction, unpredictable environments
2. **Become an AI power user**: 91% of AI-using companies will hire in 2025; 96% want AI skills
3. **Target growth industries**: Healthcare (nurse practitioners +52% by 2033), agriculture (+30 million jobs by 2028)

**The Unanswered Question:**
If 50 million jobs are impacted but 77% of new AI jobs require master's degrees, where do the other 40+ million displaced workers go? No one has an answer.

**Recommended Immediate Actions:**
- Audit your job's automation risk on O*NET
- Develop AI-proof skills (strategic thinking, negotiation, creativity)
- Assume 3-year job expiration date; build Plan B now
- Document AI usage for resume building
- Network aggressively (jobs won't come from job boards)

**Timeline:** 24-36 months before displacement accelerates past individual adaptation capacity.
