# What Is Data?

Students explore what data is, who gathers it, and how it informs decisions in everyday life. They analyze real examples of how apps and online services collect data through clicks, sensors, and interactions. The class brainstorms different types of data (numerical, categorical, personal, public) and discusses how those datasets can be used to improve services or, if misused, invade privacy.

* Concepts: data types, data sources, data ethics, privacy awareness.
  * Privacy Awareness
    * Personal Identifiable Information (PII) - Firstname, Lastname, Date of Birth, SSN, Drivers License, Address, etc.
* Outcome: Students can define “data,” distinguish between qualitative and quantitative information, and give examples of ethical and unethical data use.
* Homework: Students identify three apps they use daily and write one paragraph explaining what kind of data each collects and why it might be valuable.
