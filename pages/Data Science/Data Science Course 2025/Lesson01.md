# What Is Data?

Students explore what data is, who gathers it, and how it informs decisions in everyday life. They analyze real examples of how apps and online services collect data through clicks, sensors, and interactions. The class brainstorms different types of data (numerical, categorical, personal, public) and discusses how those datasets can be used to improve services or, if misused, invade privacy.

* Concepts: data types, data sources, data ethics, privacy awareness.
  * Privacy Awareness
    * Personal Identifiable Information (PII) - Firstname, Lastname, Date of Birth, SSN, Drivers License, Address, etc.
* Outcome: Students can define “data,” distinguish between qualitative and quantitative information, and give examples of ethical and unethical data use.
* Homework: Students identify three apps they use daily and write one paragraph explaining what kind of data each collects and why it might be valuable.

RH: You write data, read information, share knowledge. Example: I write a triangle on a sticky note. That's data. But what does it mean? When I see a triangle on a stick note, that means to buy milk.
If you could predict the future and see that a car was going to crash into you at 5th and Main St at 8:05am tomorrow, you would decide not to be there at that time.
Other than psychic ability, are best and only method to predict the future, is to understand the past and extrapolate it forward.
