**Coursera** has a bunch of data science courses (1 to 10 lessons per course) - most you can take for free. Their business models is that if you are going to spend time learning their courses, you might just want to prove you did so. So they charge you (perhaps $30 to $50) per lesson. You also get graded if you pay, and when you finish the course, you get a permalink that proves you took the class. You can put this link on your LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, whatever.
